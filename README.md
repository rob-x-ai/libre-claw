# Libre Claw

Libre Claw is a terminal-native autonomous coding agent harness built by
[Kroonen AI](https://kroonen.ai). It gives you a serious local TUI,
Telegram control, durable runs, persistent memory, browser tools, scheduled
tasks, and multi-provider model routing in one Python application.

It is built for developers who want an agent that can actually work in a
project, ask before side effects, remember useful context, and keep running
when the terminal closes.

Current release: Version `0.1.0`.

## Highlights

| Capability | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| Terminal UI | Streaming chat, file explorer, command palette, approvals, run timeline, and artifacts. |
| Telegram bridge | Talk to the same agent from Telegram, approve tools inline, and receive scheduled reports. |
| Durable runs | Every task gets a run ID, JSONL event log, summary, verification notes, and optional diff. |
| Local dashboard | Start, inspect, cancel, and approve daemon-owned runs from a browser on localhost. |
| Memory and skills | Local persistent memory, `SOUL.md` persona files, user/project `SKILL.md` workflows, and optional Vercel Skills discovery. |
| Real tools | File edits, shell, code search, web search, git, HTTP requests, browser actions, screenshots, MCP tools, and more. |
| Provider routing | OpenRouter, Ollama/Ollama Cloud, Anthropic, OpenAI, Codex OAuth, and local-compatible endpoints. |
| Petdex companion | Optional local state updates for the Petdex desktop companion app. |
| Safe defaults | API keys stay out of project config, dangerous commands are blocked, and writes require approval. |

## Install

Recommended local install:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kroonen-ai/libre-claw.git
cd libre-claw
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

One-command installer:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kroonen-ai/libre-claw/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

For browser tools:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[browser]"
python -m playwright install chromium
```

For local web search, run a private SearXNG instance:

```bash
libre-claw searx init
libre-claw searx up
libre-claw searx test
```

Libre Claw uses `http://127.0.0.1:8888` by default through the `web_search`
tool. The generated SearXNG settings enable JSON output, which is required for
agent searches. The implementation walkthrough lives in
[docs/SEARXNG_INTEGRATION.md](docs/SEARXNG_INTEGRATION.md).

Update an installed Git checkout safely:

```bash
libre-claw update
```

The updater fetches `origin/main`, compares commits, writes a backup under
`~/.libre-claw/backups/updates/`, then applies a fast-forward update. It refuses
to pull over uncommitted changes; use `libre-claw update --dry-run` to check
first.

Optional Petdex companion integration:

```toml
[petdex]
enabled = true
base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:7777"
token_path = "~/.petdex/runtime/update-token"
source = "libre-claw"
bubble_prefix = "🦞"
```

When enabled, Libre Claw sends local lifecycle updates to Petdex for daemon,
TUI, Telegram, scheduled runs, tool calls, approvals, success, and errors. Use
`/petdex status` in the TUI or Telegram to verify the token and endpoint. The
TUI also renders the active Petdex sprite from `~/.petdex` when the companion is
enabled and a pet is installed.

## First Run

Start the TUI:

```bash
libre-claw
```

Equivalent entrypoints:

```bash
libre-claw tui
libre-claw chat
python -m libre_claw
```

The TUI runs full-screen by default. Use `PageUp` / `PageDown` to scroll the
transcript, `Ctrl+Home` / `Ctrl+End` to jump, and `Ctrl+Shift+C` to copy the
current Textual selection. If you want normal terminal scrollback instead, launch
with `libre-claw tui --inline`. If you want clickable Textual mouse controls,
launch with `libre-claw tui --mouse` or set `[tui].mouse = true`.

You can attach images in the TUI by dragging an image into the terminal or
pasting its local path into a message. Use `/attach <image-path>` to queue an
image for the next prompt, `/attach paste` or `/paste-image` to pull an image
from the OS clipboard, `/attach list` to inspect queued images, and `/attach
clear` to reset them. Libre Claw renders a small terminal preview and sends the
image to vision-capable providers.

Inside the app, run:

```text
/setup status
/setup provider openrouter
/setup key openrouter
/model openrouter:openrouter/auto --global
```

The `--global` flag saves the selected provider/model to
`~/.libre-claw/config.toml`.

## Provider Setup

Libre Claw does not need real API keys in project files. Use the key store:

```bash
libre-claw auth set-key openrouter
libre-claw auth set-key anthropic
libre-claw auth set-key openai
libre-claw auth set-key ollama
libre-claw auth status
```

Or use environment variables:

```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="..."
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="..."
export OPENAI_API_KEY="..."
export OLLAMA_API_KEY="..."
```

Key lookup order:

1. Environment variable.
2. OS keyring.
3. Encrypted local fallback file at `~/.libre-claw/.keys`.

### Common Model Commands

```text
/model list
/model openrouter:qwen/qwen3.7-max --global
/model openrouter:sakana/fugu-ultra --global
/model openrouter:deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash --global
/model openrouter:moonshotai/kimi-k2.7-code --global
/model openrouter:z-ai/glm-5.2 --global
/model openrouter:minimax/minimax-m3 --global
/model openrouter:anthropic/claude-sonnet-5 --global
/model openrouter:nvidia/nemotron-3-ultra-550b-a55b:free --global
/model ollama:glm-5.2:cloud --global
/model ollama:minimax-m3:cloud --global
/model ollama:kimi-k2.6:cloud --global
/model anthropic:claude-sonnet-5 --global
/model anthropic:claude-opus-4-8 --global
/model openai:gpt-5.5 --global
/model codex:gpt-5.5 --global
```

Fallback slots let Libre Claw keep working if the primary provider is rate-limited
or down before it starts streaming. Configure up to three ordered backups:

```text
/fallback list
/fallback set 1 openrouter:openrouter/auto --global
/fallback set 2 ollama:kimi-k2.6:cloud --key-env OLLAMA_BACKUP_API_KEY --global
/fallback set 3 anthropic:claude-sonnet-5 --global
/fallback recheck 3 --global
/fallback clear all --global
```

While running on a fallback, Libre Claw retries the primary after the configured
number of fallback provider calls. The default is `3`.

## Local Web Search

`web_search` is backed by SearXNG so the agent can search the web without
scraping a commercial search page through `bash` or the browser. The default
config is:

```toml
[web_search]
enabled = true
provider = "searxng"
base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:8888"
max_results = 10
```

Useful commands:

```bash
libre-claw searx init      # write compose/settings files
libre-claw searx up        # start local SearXNG with Docker Compose
libre-claw searx status    # show container status
libre-claw searx test      # verify JSON search output
libre-claw searx down      # stop local SearXNG
```

Implementation notes and debugging tips:
[docs/SEARXNG_INTEGRATION.md](docs/SEARXNG_INTEGRATION.md).

Use `/provider` when you only want to switch providers:

```text
/provider openrouter
/provider ollama
/provider anthropic
/provider openai
/provider codex
```

### Codex / ChatGPT Login

Codex uses the supported Codex CLI login flow instead of an OpenAI API key:

```bash
libre-claw auth codex-login
```

Or inside the TUI:

```text
/codex login
/provider codex
/model codex:gpt-5.5 --global
```

## Run Surfaces

### TUI

```bash
libre-claw tui
```

Best for interactive coding, approvals, file browsing, artifacts, and local
work.

### Daemon And Dashboard

```bash
libre-claw start
libre-claw daemon
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8766/dashboard
```

The daemon owns active runs, keeps them alive after the TUI exits, exposes a
local dashboard, supervises schedules, and can start Telegram automatically
when Telegram is enabled and a stored bot token exists.

![Libre Claw dashboard GUI](docs/assets/libre-claw-dashboard-screenshot.png)

Lifecycle helpers:

```bash
libre-claw shutdown
libre-claw restart
```

`restart` reuses the last recorded mode, so a running `telegram up` stack comes
back as `telegram up`. Logs go to `~/.libre-claw/daemon.log`.

Use `libre-claw stop` when you want to cancel the active daemon turn without
shutting down Libre Claw.

### Telegram

```bash
libre-claw telegram setup --user-id 123456789
libre-claw telegram up
```

Telegram uses your numeric Telegram user ID, not your `@username`. If you are
blocked, the bot replies with the exact allow command to run.

Telegram messages can include photos or image documents. Libre Claw stores
uploads locally under `~/.libre-claw/telegram/uploads/`, passes them to
vision-capable providers, and keeps captions as the user prompt.

Useful Telegram commands:

```text
/start
/help
/new
/restart
/model
/models
/provider
/cost
/usage
/status
/daemon
/runs
/run
/compact
/schedule
/heartbeat
/memory
/cancel
/stop
/shutdown
/btw
/steer
```

## What The Agent Can Do

Libre Claw ships with production-oriented tools for:

- Reading, writing, editing, searching, and listing project files.
- Running shell commands with timeout, truncation, and permission checks.
- Inspecting git status and creating commits with approval.
- Making direct HTTP requests for APIs and downloads.
- Browsing pages with persistent Playwright profiles.
- Clicking, typing, waiting, extracting page data, dismissing cookie banners,
  taking screenshots, and saving downloads.
- Creating, updating, pausing, resuming, deleting, and listing Libre Claw
  schedules through the same permission system.
- Calling configured MCP tools through the same permission system.

Write/edit/shell/browser action tools ask first. Read-only tools are allowed by
default.

## Core Workflows

### Durable Runs

Every user task gets a run under:

```text
~/.libre-claw/runs/<run-id>/
```

Each run can include:

- `events.jsonl`
- `summary.md`
- `verification.md`
- `diff.patch`
- browser artifacts
- tool and permission events

Useful commands:

```text
/runs
/run <id>
/resume <id>
/cancel <id>
/artifacts summary <id>
/changes <id>
/approvals
```

### Persistent Memory

Libre Claw stores local memory in three layers:

- Raw session archives in `~/.libre-claw/sessions/`.
- Durable run archives in `~/.libre-claw/runs/`.
- Searchable memory items in `~/.libre-claw/memory.db`.

It can automatically extract durable facts, preferences, project decisions, and
workflow summaries after completed runs. Credential-looking data is redacted
before indexing or injection.

Useful commands:

```text
/memory status
/memory list
/memory search <query>
/memory add <text>
/memory forget <id>
/memory summarize
/memory on
/memory off
```

### Skills And Persona

Libre Claw loads reusable skills from:

```text
~/.libre-claw/skills/
<project>/.libre-claw/skills/
```

AgentSkills-style packages with `SKILL.md` are supported. Libre Claw can also
opt into the open Vercel Skills ecosystem by caching
[`vercel-labs/skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) and exposing a
read-only `skills_search` tool to the agent.

Enable external skill discovery in `~/.libre-claw/config.toml`:

```toml
[skills]
enabled = true
external_discovery_enabled = true
external_auto_refresh = true
vercel_source_enabled = true
cli_command = "npx -y skills@latest"
```

Persona files are loaded from:

```text
~/.libre-claw/SOUL.md
<project>/.libre-claw/SOUL.md
<project>/SOUL.md
```

Useful commands:

```text
/skills list
/skills sync
/skills show <name>
/skills show --external find-skills
/skills add --project <name>
/soul status
/soul init --project
/soul show
```

See [docs/VERCEL_SKILLS_INTEGRATION.md](docs/VERCEL_SKILLS_INTEGRATION.md) for
the full Vercel Skills setup and maintenance notes.

### Scheduled Work And Heartbeats

Create recurring local runs:

```text
/schedule examples
/schedule add daily 09:00 | Daily repo health check | Inspect git status, tests, and risks.
/schedule add daily 08:00 @ America/Montreal | Morning brief | Send a compact morning report.
/schedule list
/schedule pause <id>
/schedule resume <id>
```

The agent can also create and edit Libre Claw schedules itself with the
`schedule_list` and `schedule` tools. These are daemon automations, not host
cron entries, so they stay portable across TUI, dashboard, and Telegram.
Use an IANA timezone suffix such as `@ America/Montreal` for location-specific
jobs; otherwise schedules use the daemon's local timezone.

Start lightweight periodic check-ins:

```text
/heartbeat status
/heartbeat once
/heartbeat start every 30 minutes
/heartbeat stop
```

### Goal Mode

Use `/goal` for bounded autopilot work:

```text
/goal Fix the failing tests and explain the result
```

Libre Claw runs a normal agent turn, asks a separate judge model whether the
goal is complete, then continues until the judge marks it done or the turn
limit is reached.

## Important Slash Commands

```text
/help
/clear
/cancel
/exit
/cost
/compact
/model [provider:]<model> [--global]
/fallback list|set|clear|recheck
/provider <name>
/setup status
/tools list
/runs
/memory status
/skills list
/workspace status
/telegram
/petdex status
```

Keybindings:

- `Ctrl+B`: toggle file explorer.
- `Ctrl+P`: command palette.
- `Ctrl+Shift+C`: copy last assistant response.
- `Esc`: cancel active generation/tool execution.
- `Ctrl+C`: exit the app.
- `Tab`: accept the first slash-command suggestion.

## Configuration

Main config:

```text
~/.libre-claw/config.toml
```

Show bundled defaults:

```bash
libre-claw config defaults
```

Common environment overrides:

```bash
LIBRE_CLAW_DEFAULT_PROVIDER=openrouter
LIBRE_CLAW_DEFAULT_MODEL=openrouter/auto
LIBRE_CLAW_WORKING_DIRECTORY=/path/to/project
```

Initialize a dedicated workspace:

```bash
libre-claw workspace init
```

By default, this creates:

```text
~/Documents/.workspace/libre-claw
```

## Safety Model

Libre Claw is powerful because it can touch your files, shell, browser, and git
history. The default posture is local-first and permissioned:

- API keys are read from environment variables, keyring, or encrypted local
  fallback storage.
- Provider keys are not written to project config files.
- File writes, edits, shell commands, browser navigation/actions, downloads,
  git commits, and MCP actions ask for approval.
- Dangerous shell patterns are blocked by the sandbox layer.
- File access is restricted to the configured working directory by default.
- Memory redacts credential-looking strings before indexing or prompt
  injection.
- Runs are append-only and inspectable through JSONL logs and artifacts.

## Troubleshooting

### macOS says `externally-managed-environment`

Use a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Missing API key

```bash
libre-claw auth status
libre-claw auth set-key openrouter
```

Replace `openrouter` with `anthropic`, `openai`, or `ollama`. For Codex:

```bash
libre-claw auth codex-login
```

### Ollama Cloud returns 401

Make sure you stored the real Ollama API key, not the model name:

```bash
libre-claw auth set-key ollama
```

For direct Ollama Cloud API use:

```toml
[providers.ollama]
base_url = "https://ollama.com"
api_format = "ollama"
api_key_env = "OLLAMA_API_KEY"
```

For local Ollama daemon use:

```toml
[providers.ollama]
base_url = "http://localhost:11434"
api_format = "ollama"
api_key_env = ""
```
