# Libre Claw

Libre Claw is a terminal-native AI coding agent harness from Kroonen AI Inc.
(https://kroonen.ai). It runs as a single Python TUI app, streams model output,
uses permissioned tools for coding tasks, supports Telegram, and keeps provider
keys out of project config files.

Version `0.1.0` is the first shippable release. It is early, but functional:
you can launch the TUI, choose Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter, Ollama, or Codex, chat
with the agent, approve tool calls, browse files, save sessions, use memory,
and run the Telegram daemon.

## What You Get

- Textual terminal UI with streaming Markdown chat.
- Providers: Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter, Ollama, and Codex CLI auth.
- Ollama support for local daemon use, Ollama Cloud, and OpenAI-compatible
  Ollama endpoints.
- Built-in tools: `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`, `list_directory`,
  `glob`, `search_files`, `git_status`, `git_commit`, `think`,
  `browser_navigate`, `browser_read`, `browser_screenshot`, and `bash`.
- `/goal` supervised mode that keeps the agent working for up to a bounded
  number of turns until a separate judge model marks the objective complete.
- Durable local runs with IDs, append-only event logs, run artifacts, and
  `/runs`, `/run <id>`, `/resume <id>`, and `/cancel <id>` controls.
- Interactive permission prompts for write/edit/shell actions.
- File explorer, hidden on startup, whose root can move up and down with the user.
- SQLite-backed memory, saved sessions, and context compaction.
- Secure API key storage through environment variables, OS keyring, or an
  encrypted fallback file.
- Telegram daemon with allowlist auth.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11 or newer.
- A provider API key if you use a cloud provider.
- Optional: Ollama installed locally if you want local daemon mode.
- Optional: a Telegram bot token if you use the Telegram daemon.
- Optional: Playwright installed if you want headless browser tools.

## Install From This Repo

Use a virtual environment. This avoids macOS/Homebrew's
`externally-managed-environment` pip error.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kroonen-ai/libre-claw.git
cd libre-claw
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

For browser tools:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[browser]"
python -m playwright install chromium
```

Run the app:

```bash
libre-claw
```

or:

```bash
python -m libre_claw
```

Build and install a wheel locally:

```bash
python -m build
python -m pip install dist/libre_claw-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

## First Provider Setup

Libre Claw never needs real API keys in TOML. Use environment variables:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="..."
export OPENAI_API_KEY="..."
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="..."
export OLLAMA_API_KEY="..."
```

or store them securely:

```bash
libre-claw auth set-key anthropic
libre-claw auth set-key openai
libre-claw auth set-key openrouter
libre-claw auth set-key ollama
libre-claw auth codex-login
libre-claw auth status
```

Key lookup order is:

1. Environment variable.
2. OS keyring.
3. Encrypted fallback file at `~/.libre-claw/.keys`.

Codex is different: `/codex login` and `libre-claw auth codex-login` use the
supported Codex CLI ChatGPT login flow. Libre Claw does not read or copy Codex
private token files.

## Fast Starts

### OpenRouter

```bash
libre-claw auth set-key openrouter
libre-claw
```

Inside the TUI:

```text
/model openrouter:openrouter/auto
```

Libre Claw always sends OpenRouter app attribution as `Libre Claw` from
`https://kroonen.ai`, including the `cli-agent` category. Users do not configure
those product identity headers.

### Ollama Cloud With Kimi K2.6

```bash
libre-claw auth set-key ollama
libre-claw
```

Inside the TUI:

```text
/model ollama:kimi-k2.6:cloud
```

For direct Ollama Cloud API use, your config should point at Ollama's cloud
host:

```toml
[general]
default_provider = "ollama"
default_model = "kimi-k2.6:cloud"

[providers.ollama]
base_url = "https://ollama.com"
default_model = "kimi-k2.6:cloud"
api_format = "ollama"
api_key_env = "OLLAMA_API_KEY"
```

If you want the local Ollama daemon to handle cloud auth instead:

```bash
ollama signin
ollama pull kimi-k2.6:cloud
```

```toml
[general]
default_provider = "ollama"
default_model = "kimi-k2.6:cloud"

[providers.ollama]
base_url = "http://localhost:11434"
default_model = "kimi-k2.6:cloud"
api_format = "ollama"
api_key_env = ""
```

### Anthropic

```bash
libre-claw auth set-key anthropic
libre-claw
```

Default model:

```toml
[general]
default_provider = "anthropic"
default_model = "claude-opus-4-6"
```

### OpenAI

```bash
libre-claw auth set-key openai
libre-claw
```

Default example:

```toml
[general]
default_provider = "openai"
default_model = "gpt-5.5"
```

### Codex / ChatGPT Login

If you want the Open-Claw-style path where users sign in with Codex/ChatGPT
instead of pasting an OpenAI API key, use the Codex provider:

```bash
libre-claw
```

Inside the TUI:

```text
/codex login
/provider codex
/model codex:gpt-5.5 --global
```

Equivalent terminal commands:

```bash
libre-claw auth codex-login
libre-claw auth codex-status
```

This delegates turns to `codex exec` using the user's Codex CLI login. It is a
provider bridge, not API-key storage.

## Model Switching

Use `/model` from inside the TUI:

```text
/model
/model list
/model kimi-k2.6:cloud
/model ollama:kimi-k2.6:cloud
/model openrouter:qwen/qwen3.7-max --global
/model openrouter:openrouter/auto
```

`/model <name>` changes the model for the current provider.
`/model <provider>:<name>` changes provider and model together.
Add `--global` to save the selected provider/model as the default in
`~/.libre-claw/config.toml`.
Press `Tab` after `/model ` to complete known presets.

Use `/provider` when you only want to switch provider:

```text
/provider anthropic
/provider openai
/provider openrouter
/provider ollama
/provider codex
```

Legacy configs that still say `default_provider = "local"` or
`[providers.local]` are accepted and normalized to `ollama`.

## TUI Commands

- `/help`
- `/clear`
- `/cancel`
- `/cost`
- `/model [provider:]<name>|list [--global]`
- `/provider anthropic|openai|openrouter|ollama|codex`
- `/codex login|status|logout|use [model]`
- `/save [name]`
- `/load <name>`
- `/compact [status|--force] [--keep N]`
- `/goal <objective>|status|stop|max N`
- `/runs [N]`
- `/run <id>`
- `/resume <id>`
- `/tools expand|collapse|toggle <index>`
- `/memory list|add <fact>|forget <id>`
- `/telegram`
- `/exit`

Useful keybindings:

- `Ctrl+B` toggles the file tree.
- The file tree also has a `Hide` button. When hidden, a left-side `Files`
  button brings it back.
- `Ctrl+P` opens the command palette.
- `Ctrl+Shift+C` copies the last assistant response.
- `Esc` or `/cancel` cancels active generation/tool execution.
- `Ctrl+C` exits the app.
- `Tab` completes the first slash-command suggestion.

## Context Tracking

The status bar includes a compact context meter:

```text
ctx [##--------]
```

The meter is an estimated-token view of the current system prompt, summary,
memory facts, and conversation against `[agent].context_window_tokens`.

Use `/compact status` for details, `/compact` for normal compaction, and
`/compact --force --keep 4` when you want to summarize aggressively while
keeping only the latest four messages.

## Goal Mode

Use `/goal` for bounded autopilot work:

```text
/goal Fix the failing tests and commit the result
```

Libre Claw runs one normal agent turn, asks a separate judge model whether the
goal is done, then reprompts the agent with the judge's next instruction until
the judge returns done or the max-turn limit is reached. The default limit is
20 turns.

Useful controls:

- `/goal status`
- `/goal stop`
- `/goal max 20`

The judge has no tools. It only reads the transcript and returns a strict
done/continue decision, so file and shell permissions still go through the
normal Libre Claw approval flow.

## Token And Cost Tracking

Libre Claw tracks provider-reported token usage cumulatively for the current
session. Use `/cost` in the TUI, or `/cost` in Telegram, to see total input,
output, cached, and reasoning tokens.

For OpenRouter, Libre Claw requests OpenRouter usage accounting on every
OpenRouter call, so `/cost` also shows the provider-reported request cost when
OpenRouter returns it. The status bar updates live with the same cumulative
session total.

## Tool Permissions

Read/list/search/status/think tools run without prompting. File writes, file
edits, git commits, browser navigation, and shell commands ask first.

Permission prompts render as an interactive panel with:

- Approve
- Deny
- Always Tool
- Always Command

They also accept `y`, `n`, `a`, and `!` shortcuts. Dangerous sandbox-blocked
bash commands show a warning and only allow one-time approval or denial.

## Durable Runs

Every chat turn and `/goal` objective creates a durable run under:

```bash
~/.libre-claw/runs/<run-id>/
```

Each run stores:

- `meta.json`
- `events.jsonl`
- `summary.md` with the final assistant output or failure summary.
- `verification.md` with final state, recent tool outcomes, git status, and
  artifact notes.
- `diff.patch` with the tracked-file git diff at finish when Libre Claw is
  running inside a git repository.

Use `/runs` to list recent runs, `/run <id>` to inspect metadata and event
counts, `/resume <id>` to reload a run transcript into the TUI, and
`/cancel <id>` to mark a run cancelled. The diff artifact intentionally does
not embed untracked files; they are listed in `verification.md` through git
status so the user can decide how to handle them.

## File Explorer

The file explorer has an `Up` control. Moving the explorer root also updates
the agent working directory, so tools follow the directory you are browsing.

On startup, the TUI shows Libre Claw ASCII art and a collapsed version header.
Click the header to reveal the latest release notes from `RELEASE.md`.

## Telegram

The standalone Telegram daemon uses the same agent core:

```bash
export TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="..."
libre-claw telegram
```

Configure allowed Telegram user IDs in `~/.libre-claw/config.toml`:

```toml
[telegram]
enabled = true
allowed_user_ids = [123456789]
```

## Configuration

Bundled defaults:

```bash
libre-claw config defaults
```

User configuration is loaded from:

```text
~/.libre-claw/config.toml
```

Basic settings can be overridden with:

- `LIBRE_CLAW_DEFAULT_PROVIDER`
- `LIBRE_CLAW_DEFAULT_MODEL`
- `LIBRE_CLAW_WORKING_DIRECTORY`
- `LIBRE_CLAW_THEME`
- `LIBRE_CLAW_LOG_LEVEL`

The runtime agent system prompt lives in the `[agent]` config section as
`system_prompt`, with `system_prompt_extra` available for local additions. The
default prompt identifies Libre Claw as a Kroonen AI Inc. agent harness.

Sandbox defaults restrict file access to the configured working directory and
block dangerous shell patterns such as root removal, `sudo`, and remote install
pipes.

## Troubleshooting

### `externally-managed-environment`

Create and activate a virtual environment, then install inside it:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Missing API Key

Run:

```bash
libre-claw auth status
libre-claw auth set-key openrouter
```

Replace `openrouter` with `anthropic`, `openai`, or `ollama`. For Codex, use
`/codex login` in the TUI or `libre-claw auth codex-login`.

### Ollama Cloud 401

Make sure you are not using the model name as the bearer token. Store or export
the real Ollama API key:

```bash
libre-claw auth set-key ollama
```

or:

```bash
export OLLAMA_API_KEY="..."
```

Then use:

```toml
[providers.ollama]
base_url = "https://ollama.com"
api_format = "ollama"
api_key_env = "OLLAMA_API_KEY"
```

## Development

```bash
python -m pytest
python -m compileall src tests
git diff --check
```
