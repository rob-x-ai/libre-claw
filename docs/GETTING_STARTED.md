# Getting Started in 5 Minutes

Libre Claw is a terminal-native coding agent harness built by Kroonen AI.

## 1. Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kroonen-ai/libre-claw/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

Private repository or self-hosted installs can point the same installer at another
HTTPS remote:

```bash
LIBRE_CLAW_REPO_URL=https://git.kroonen.ai/kroonen-ai/libre-claw.git \
  curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kroonen-ai/libre-claw/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

## 2. Launch

```bash
libre-claw
```

If `~/.local/bin` is not on your `PATH`, run:

```bash
~/.local/bin/libre-claw
```

Useful launch surfaces:

```bash
libre-claw tui       # terminal chat UI
libre-claw chat      # alias for the TUI
libre-claw daemon    # local API, dashboard, automations, and daemon-owned runs
```

When the daemon is running, open the local dashboard at
`http://127.0.0.1:8766/dashboard`.

Update the installed Git checkout safely:

```bash
libre-claw update
```

The updater fetches `origin/main`, writes a backup under
`~/.libre-claw/backups/updates/`, and only applies a clean fast-forward. Use
`libre-claw update --dry-run` to check first without changing files.

## 3. Set up a provider

Inside the TUI:

```text
/setup status
/setup provider openrouter
/setup key openrouter
/model openrouter:qwen/qwen3.7-max --global
```

Codex/ChatGPT auth is also available:

```text
/setup codex
/provider codex
```

## 4. Run a coding task

```text
Fix the failing tests and commit the result.
```

Libre Claw reads before editing, asks before write/shell/browser actions,
and save a durable run under `~/.libre-claw/runs/<run_id>/`.

## 5. Review the work

```text
/runs
/artifacts summary
/artifacts diff
/usage openrouter
/memory status
```

For longer autonomous work:

```text
/goal Implement the feature, run tests, and stop when verified.
```

You can also attach images from the TUI. Drag an image into the terminal or
paste its local path in a message, or queue one explicitly:

```text
/attach ~/Desktop/screenshot.png
What is wrong in this UI?
```

If the image is already copied to the OS clipboard, use `/attach paste` or
`/paste-image` before your next prompt. Use `/attach list` and `/attach clear`
to manage queued images. Vision-capable providers receive the image block;
Codex CLI currently receives text only.

Libre Claw automatically keeps local persistent memory. Raw session archives
stay in `~/.libre-claw/sessions/`, durable runs stay in `~/.libre-claw/runs/`,
and searchable memory lives in `~/.libre-claw/memory.db`. Use `/memory list`,
`/memory search <query>`, `/memory add <text>`, and `/memory forget <id>` when
you want to inspect or steer what gets remembered.

Skills are loaded from bundled, global, and project-local `SKILL.md` files. For
specialized workflows you can add project skills under
`<project>/.libre-claw/skills/`, or opt into the Vercel Skills ecosystem so the
agent can discover relevant external skills when local playbooks are not enough:

```toml
[skills]
external_discovery_enabled = true
cli_command = "npx -y skills@latest"
```

Then sync and inspect from the TUI or Telegram:

```text
/skills sync
/skills list
/skills show --external find-skills
```

External skills are cached locally under `~/.libre-claw/skills/catalogs/` and
remain read-only until you copy or adapt one into your own global/project skill
folder.

## 6. Optional: Telegram

Create a bot with BotFather, then set up Libre Claw with your numeric Telegram
user ID:

```bash
libre-claw telegram setup --user-id 123456789
```

The setup command stores the bot token in the secure key store or encrypted
fallback file, not in TOML. If you do not know your numeric ID yet, message the
bot once; Libre Claw will reply with the exact `libre-claw telegram allow ...`
command to run.

After setup, either start everything with the combined helper:

```bash
libre-claw telegram up
```

or start the normal daemon:

```bash
libre-claw daemon
```

If `[telegram].enabled = true`, `[telegram].use_daemon = true`, and a bot token
is available, the daemon starts and supervises the Telegram bridge
automatically. Telegram approvals, schedules, memory commands, and model
switching all route through the same durable run store.

Telegram also accepts photos and image documents. Captions become the prompt;
uncaptioned images default to "Please inspect the attached image." Uploaded
files stay local in `~/.libre-claw/telegram/uploads/` and are passed to
vision-capable providers.

## 7. Optional: Petdex Companion

Libre Claw can update the local [Petdex](https://petdex.dev/) desktop companion
as runs move from ready to running, tool use, approval, success, or error.

Install and launch Petdex separately, then enable the local sidecar integration:

```toml
[petdex]
enabled = true
base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:7777"
token_path = "~/.petdex/runtime/update-token"
source = "libre-claw"
bubble_prefix = "🦞"
```

Check it from the TUI or Telegram:

```text
/petdex status
```

When the integration is enabled, the TUI reads the active Petdex pet from
`~/.petdex`, renders the companion sprite above the chat transcript, and prefixes
Petdex desktop bubbles so they are visibly coming from Libre Claw.

## Terminal Selection

Libre Claw runs full-screen by default and disables Textual mouse capture. Use
`PageUp` / `PageDown` to scroll the transcript, `Ctrl+Home` / `Ctrl+End` to
jump, and `Ctrl+Shift+C` to copy the current Textual selection. Enable clickable
mouse controls with:

```bash
libre-claw tui --mouse
```

For normal terminal scrollback instead of the full-screen alternate-screen
layout, use:

```bash
libre-claw tui --inline
```

The same defaults can be persisted in `~/.libre-claw/config.toml`:

```toml
[tui]
mouse = false
inline = false
```
