# Changelog

## 0.1.0 - 2026-05-24

Initial shippable Libre Claw release.

### Added

- Textual terminal UI with streaming chat, status bar, file tree, command palette, slash-command suggestions, `/model` provider/model onboarding, startup ASCII art, startup release notes, and interactive permission prompts.
- `/model <provider>:<model> --global` persists the selected provider/model in
  `~/.libre-claw/config.toml`.
- Status bar context meter plus `/compact status`, `/compact --force`, and
  `/compact --keep N` controls for context-window management.
- Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter, and Ollama providers. Defaults are `claude-opus-4-6`, `gpt-5.5`, and `qwen3.6:27b`; Ollama supports local daemon use, Ollama Cloud with `kimi-k2.6:cloud`, and Ollama/OpenAI-compatible endpoints.
- Fixed OpenRouter app attribution for Libre Claw with `https://kroonen.ai`, `Libre Claw`, and `cli-agent` headers.
- Cumulative session token tracking in the status bar, TUI `/cost`, and
  Telegram `/cost`, with OpenRouter usage accounting enabled for
  provider-reported request cost, cached tokens, and reasoning tokens.
- Native Ollama tool calling and XML tool-call fallback for models without native support.
- ReAct-style async agent loop with concurrent tool execution.
- Built-in `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`, `list_directory`, `glob`,
  `search_files`, `git_status`, `git_commit`, `think`, `browser_navigate`,
  `browser_read`, `browser_screenshot`, and `bash` tools.
- Working-directory sandboxing, blocked shell command patterns, and approval gates for side-effecting tools.
- File explorer parent navigation that updates the agent working directory, plus visible hide/show controls and a left-side restore rail.
- TUI polish including thin `#0070F3` scrollbars, blue user labels, purple `#8B5CF6` Libre Claw assistant labels, and cleaner panel borders.
- SQLite memory for facts, sessions, summaries, and file edit logs.
- Telegram daemon with allowlist auth, streaming updates, and inline permission prompts.
- Key storage through environment variables, OS keyring, or encrypted local fallback.
- OAuth 2.0 PKCE and JWT scaffolding for a future dashboard.
- Apache-2.0 licensing with Kroonen AI Inc. source headers.
- GitHub Actions test/build CI and expanded user-facing README documentation.
- Test coverage for config, providers, tools, permissions, memory, Telegram, auth, and TUI helpers.
